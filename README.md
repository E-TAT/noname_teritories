# 🗺️ ESX Territories Script (Radius-Based Modification)

This repository contains a **modified version of an existing ESX FiveM territories script**.
The original script was created by another author.
My contribution focuses on **core gameplay logic changes**, not a full rewrite.

The main change:
👉 **Territory borders were converted from fixed zones to a customizable radius-based system**, with visible markers and configurable visuals.

## ✨ What I Changed (My Contribution)

* Replaced **zone-based territory borders** with **radius-based territories**
* Radius is:

  * Fully configurable
  * Visually represented in-game
* Marker appearance is customizable:

  * Size
  * Type
  * Color
* Improved flexibility for territory design and balancing

These changes make territories **more dynamic and easier to tune** compared to rigid zone definitions.
